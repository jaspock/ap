# Summary

These are the teaching materials for the course _Aprendizaje Profundo_ (deep learning), coordinated by [Antonio Pertusa](https://www.dlsi.ua.es/~pertusa) and also taught by professors [Juan Antonio Pérez](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/es/perez-ortiz-juan-antonio/15404), [Andrés Fuster](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/es/fuster-guillo-andres/10095), [Jorge Azorín](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/curriculum-breve/es/azorin-lopez-jorge/9826), and [Jorge Calvo](https://www.dlsi.ua.es/~jcalvo/).

For information regarding the course assessment, please refer to the Moodle contents at UACloud and the [course official info page](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/Guia-Docente/GuiaDocente/Index?wcodest=D114&wcodasi=43509&wlengua=es&scaca=2024-25). 

## Methodology and evaluation


- The theory contents should be revised by the student **before** attending the practical sessions. A test will be answered to ensure that these contents are read and understood by the student. 
- Practical assignments (jupyter notebooks) are to be completed as indicated in each assignment description. Each of the course blocks will have one or more practical assignments. 

The theory tests represent 30% of the final grade.  The assignments represent 70% of the final grade.
<!--
- Attendance in practical sessions is mandatory. Roll call will be taken in each in-person session. A maximum of 1 unexcused absence is allowed. If a student accumulates more unexcused absences than the allowed limit, they will not be able to pass the practical component of the course in the C2 examination. However, they will have the opportunity to pass it in the C4.
