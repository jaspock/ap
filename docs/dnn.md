# From Shallow to Deep Neural Networks

## Objectives

* To understand the fundamentals of a basic multilayer perceptron neural network MLP/ Shallow neural network. 
* To understand the concept of a "basic neuron" and the concepts of "activation function", "loss function" and by extension the "cost function". 
* To understand the concept of "gradient descent" through the use of function derivatives and the chain rule. 
* To understand the idea of forward and backward propagation as a basis for the search for minima in the gradient descent process. 
* To analyze the basis of deep neural networks with multiple inner layers. 
* Understanding hyperparameters in a deep neural network and some techniques for improving error.

## Contents

* Supervised learning fundamentals (cross validation, overfitting, ‚Ä¶)
* Logistic Regression fundamentals
* Activation Function types
* Loss function - Cost function
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression Derivatives (chain rule)
* Forward and Backward propagation
* MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)/ Shallow neural networks
* Deep L-layer Neural Networks
* Dropout, early stopping, parameter initialization

## Methodology

* **Self-study of the proposed theoretical materials**. These materials are structured using bibliographical references to explain the theoretical concepts.
‚ñ™ **Moodle Tests**: Moodle tests are proposed to evaluate the theoretical contents and to guarantee the learning to tackle the practical part. These moodle tests **must be taken before the practical session**.
‚ñ™ **Workbooks**: Several practical workbooks are proposed to improve the skills of design, implementation and configuration of neural network models.

## Recommended reading for self-study of theoretical content

To understand the proposed theoretical contents, the following bibliographic
resources are proposed for reading.

    [This part can take about 3,5 hours üïíÔ∏è.]

* For a quick introduction to the concept of neural networks, activation functions, loss function, gradient descent, backpropagation, chain rule, hyperparameters, we recommend reading [Brief Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks. Section 3](https://eduscol.education.fr/sti/sites/eduscol.education.fr.sti/files/ressources/pedagogiques/14500/14500-brief-introduction-to-artificial-neural-networks-ensps.pdf). This part can take about 30 min üïíÔ∏è of personal working.
